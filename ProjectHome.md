# Description #
If you want to integrate AIM into a Flash, Flex, or AIR app, this project is meant to make it easier for you.  This library is at the core of [AIM Express 7](http://www.aim.com/aimexpress.adp).

We are actively developing the code as we build out our client.  We push updates out periodically when we refresh AIM Express 7.

We decided to go with straight AS3 libraries.  We didn't want to force anyone to use the CS3 components or Flex.  This library does not contain any UI.  It communicates with the AIM backend using the [Web AIM](http://developer.aim.com/ref_api) (WIM) protocol in AMF3 format.

AIM is used by millions of people.  It's the #1 IM network in North America.  If your product could benefit from tapping into that network, we're eager to help you.

# Starting Points #

The QuickStartGuide should give you a quick glimpse of how things work.

The [Roadmap](http://code.google.com/p/wimas3/wiki/Roadmap) describes where we are and where we plan to go.

See also the burgeoning [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/wimas3/wiki/FAQ).  As we get more questions, we'll build it out.

The full docs are on the [downloads page](http://code.google.com/p/wimas3/downloads/list).
